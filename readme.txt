This repo. consists of a coding Challenge as part of Unimelb EdTech developer position. 
I was able to pass the Screening test, it was based in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Time limit : 45 minutes

@ Author : Mohammed Ahsan Kollathodi. 

    REQUIREMENTS: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. When a user clicks on the 'Submit' button, the content of the input field should appear in the box labelled 'Number List' - DONE
   2. After clicking the Submit button, the input field should go blank - DONE 
   3. Each unique number entered will be added to the list and should appear on a new line - yet to complete - appears on the same line at the moment. 
   4. Input can contain only integers, or an error will be displayed - DONE
   5.Numbers must be positive integers, or an error will be displayed - DONE
   6.Any repeated number will not be added - DONE
   7.If possible, numbers in the list will be sorted from from lowest to highest, top to bottom. - DONE (left to right sorted)
   8.Nothing should happen if the button is clicked while the input field is blank - Display error message with blank input - DONE 
   9. Logo position Adjustment - yet to complete 
   
    MY SOLUTION APPROACH : 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Accept the input values into an array called 'n'
    2. If the entry is a null value or an empty field display error 
        else : Append the appropriate input into the array. 
        - Multiple checks done to ensure that appropriate input is entered into the array. 
        - Entry not allowed if the input is not a number. 
    3. Once the values are entered into the array - sort the array. 
    4. Produce the array in the list with unique values. 
    5. A separate functionality to ensure that the array does not consist of duplicate values. 
    ALITER SOLUTION : Dynamic list in js with sort functionality with different ds. - list.js
